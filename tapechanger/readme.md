First Job starts on specific Weekday, but next Job at next Day but Tapejob will be write the first day.

Script reads actual Weekday, when first Job starts and write a file with name for example "tuesday.veeam". 

After the second job, Post-Script read the filename and run the job with the correct Job-ID.
